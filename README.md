You will need to provide a image file for this project to analyze. 
I intend to create a 2d mapped image with DJI Terra and a DJI Mavic in order to analyze and entire Construction site all at once. 
Any Image will process though.

The pixel analysis is not all inclusive. I have not been able to do any real world testing. 

If you use this project, then you should create a list of specific colors by using the Windows Color Picker (Win + Shift + c)

Then trial and error analyzing the result and adding in new colors should result in a conclusive Database of Colors that do not represent Vegetation.
